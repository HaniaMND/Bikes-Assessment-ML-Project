# Bikes-Assessment-ML-Project
This repo contains the implementation of an End To End machine learning project to to predict the bike demand (bike users count) based on historical usage patterns and weather data.

## **Objective :**

This project aims to predict the count of total rental bikes based on historical usage patterns and weather data.

## Approach :

1. Using a provided “Bikes rental” dataset
2. Using various Best possible ML models (algorithms) ⇒ Report the best performing model
3. Fine-tune this model using one of the model fine-tuning techniques ⇒ Report the best possible combination of hyperparameters for the selected model
4. Use the selected model to make final predictions and compare with the actual values.

## Process :

1. Importing the libraries
2. Using some pre-defined utility functions
3. Loading the data
4. Cleaning the data
5. Dividing the dataset into training and test dataset
6. Training several models and analyzing their performance to select a model
7. Fine-tuning the model by finding the best hyper-parameters and features
8. Evaluating selected model using test dataset
